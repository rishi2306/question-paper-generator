# question-paper-generator
This is a question paper generator that can generate various unique question papers from one single question bank consisting of all questions.
It is still being developed, please do point out any bugs and/or enhancements.

Step 1: Download qbank.txt - It is question bank consisting random questions. The number assigned to M in {} next to the question is how many marks that question is valued for.
Step 2: Download QPgenerator.py and open the code in any IDE.
Step 3: Copy the file path where qbank.txt was downloaded for you and paste it in line 4, replace it with the existing file path, do not change the "/qbank.txt", "r")" part of the code.
Step 4: Write the file path of where you want your question papers to be stored in lines 55 and 80, replace everything until "/qpaper".
Step 5: Run the code

NOTE: The code only works for option 1. Making question papers on the basis of given number of questions and option 3 i.e Making question papers on the basis of number of questions and marks and doesn't work for option 2 i.e making question papers only on the basis of given total marks.
